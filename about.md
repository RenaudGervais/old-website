Hello! I am currently a PhD student at Inria Bordeaux, France where I study under the supervision of [Martin Hachet](http://www.labri.fr/perso/hachet/) and I am part of the Inria [Potioc](http://team.inria.fr/potioc/) research team.

## Creative Coding
I am a big fan of the multipurpose creative coding toolkit [vvvv](http://www.vvvv.org). It allows a dynamic and playful experience to prototype visualizations or interactive systems.

There is also an open source project called [vvvv.js](http://wwww.vvvvjs.com) that now enables embedding vvvv in your browser.[^1]
